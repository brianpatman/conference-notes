## Fundamentals

### Effectively Creating Prompts
https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts

Levels of Explanation 
- broad vs narrow; can explain something as a 1st grader vs someone in highschool vs an astrophysicist
- Top books I should read this year vs top 10 books I should read as an up and coming muusician


Formula
1) How do you want ChatGPT to engage with you?
 - "You're going to act as..."
 - If you want to reset it, start with "Ignore all previous instructions before this one"
 - "Tone friendly and casual","Tone serious and format", etc...
 - 
2) Give your model a task to complete; your task is to create XYZ in XYZ words
3) Be specific; do not include XYZ, remove this symbol or number
4) Ask follow-up quesitons and further elaborate
5) Consider the output; if it's not what you want, refine the prompt to be as specific as possible


### Modifiers for Better Outputs

- Qualifiers   - "some","a few","many","most","all"
- Adjectives   - "red","happy","large ","exciting", "depressing"
- Adverbs      - "quickly","well","loudly"
- Intensifiers - "very","extremely","totally"
- Negatives    - "not","never","no"
- Number words - "one","two","few","many","several" that indicate quantity
- Time words   - "now","yet","soon"
- Place words  - "here","there","everywhere"
- Degree words - indicate the extent or degree to which something is true; "totally","completely","slightly"

### ChatGPT Tokens

ChatGPT 3.5 has a limit of 4096 tokens
ChatGPT 4 has a limit of ~8000 tokens

The prompt you put in and the output of ChatGPT are both included the token limit. Whatever is left in your token limit, ChatGPT fills with previous conversation details.

1 token = 4 english characters
1-2 sentences = 30 tokens
1 paragraph = 100 tokens
1500 words = 2048 tokens

When you start getting to your token limit, ChatGPTs response seems to get less accurate.

If you are having a long conversation, you can ask ChatGPT to summarize the conversation so far so it remembers everything you have talked about.

### Copyright Shield
OpenAI has announced they will pay any costs incurred for using ChatGPT in a case of copyright infringement. Anything ChatGPT creates you are 100% able to use for monetary gain for your business.

### SearchGPT Feature
Gives ChatGPT current access to the web. Not only returns links, but can summarize content and content from links.

Uses Bing to provide live info.

Only available on GPT-4


### Create your ChatGPT Prompt
Ask ChatGPT to act as a specific role, use the prompt formula, and use modifiers


## Prompt Engineering

### What is Prompt Engineering?
The process of optimizing and designing prompts that are clear, concise, and effective in eliciting the right response.

**3 Principles of Prompt Engineering**
1) Be Specific - The more criteria you give, the more focused the output will be
2) Work in steps - Break tasks into small chunks. This returns better restuls, just as it would with a human
3) Iterate and Improve - Rework the inputs and have ChatGPT improve on it's own output.

**Good Prompting Boils Down to**
- Clear and Concise Language that is direct and unambiguous
- The persona that you assign ChatGPT aka who it will be acting as in the prompt
- The ifnormation and examples that you provide via your input (info and examples can be read by ChatGPT in the previous chat history)
- A specific task that you are requesting ChatGPT to complete AKA your desired output
- Refinement as needed once you receive your first response aka reiteration until receiving the desired output

**Main Prompting Steps**
1) Define the problem or goal - Clearly articulate what you want ChatGPT to help you with and what kind of response you are looking for.
2) Use relevant keywords and phrases - Input the most useful industry and topic-related terms into the prompt, which will help guide ChatGPT toward generating the desired response
3) Write the prompt - Craft a concise prompt that clearly communicates the information and task that is required, using the keywords and phrases identied in steps 1 and 2.
4) Test, evaluate and iterate - Generate responses with ChatGPT, evaluate the results, and adjust the prompt as necessary to elicit the desired response. Repeat the process until a successful prompt is created that consistently generates the desired response.

### Prompt Priming
“Priming” refers to the practice of providing some initial input to the model before generating a response. The initial input is intended to guide the model toward generating a response that is more relevant and coherent with the user's intended output. 

**(You can input entire pieces of text you’ve written for ChatGPT to be trained on)**

These pieces of text can be entire pages of writing you have come up with so ChatGPT can emulate your writing style, or examples of titles you have come up with

#### Example 1
*Without priming:* Where should I go on my next vacation?

*With priming:* I’d like to go on a trip with my wife and kids, the location should be tropical, we’d love to be close to the beach, I’d like the ight to be one direct ight to and from LAX, and I have a travel budget of $5,000. Where should I go on my next vacation?

*Priming Output:* One suggestion for your tropical family vacation within a $5,000 budget could be Cancun, Mexico. Direct ights from LAX are available, and you can find affordable all-inclusive packages with prices starting at around $1,000 per person for a week-long stay. Popular family activities in Cancun include snorkeling,
visiting ancient ruins, and exploring local beaches and restaurants.


#### Example 2
*Without priming:* Please create 3 potential titles for my new online course that teaches how to use AI.

*With priming:* Please create 3 potential titles for my new online course that teaches how to use AI. Here is an example of my recent course titles, please emulate the styling and written format of these: “Video Editing Masterclass: Edit Your Videos Like a Pro!” “Cinematography Masterclass: The Complete Videography Guide”

*Priming Output:*
1. AI Mastery: The Complete Guide to Using Articial Intelligence
2. The AI Expert: Learn to Harness the Power of Articial Intelligence
3. AI Foundations: A Step-by-Step Guide to Using Articial Intelligence

### Focused Prompt Frameworks
Presented below are a set of highly eective prompt frameworks aimed at enhancing focus and precision in generating outputs. By providing a specic framework, these prompts enable ChatGPT to produce more detailed, repeatable, and accurate responses.

#### Shot Prompting:
The three variations of shot prompting entail giving ChatGPT complete autonomy to generate any response with zero shot prompting, to placing parameters and giving reference data with one and few shot prompting.

**Prompt Formula**
- Zero Shot: No previous data or guidelines given before completing request.
- One Shot: One piece of data or guideline given before completing request.
- Few Shot: Multiple pieces of data or guidelines given before completing request.

Examples
- Zero Shot: “Write a YouTube script for my tech review channel.”
- One Shot: “Using this Example 1 as reference, write a YouTube script for my tech review channel.”
- Few Shot: “Using these Example 1, 2, 3 as reference, write a 5 minute YouTube script on the latest iPhone camera specications for my tech review channel. Start with a 10 second hook and notate a photo for each main point.”


#### Chain of Thought Prompting:
This framework is a technique to guide ChatGPT to explain its answers in a step-by-step format of its reasoning process. This technique helps ensure that the model's answers are transparent and easy to understand, making its explanations more useful for educational or explanatory purposes.

**Prompt Formula**
- [Your question]. Let’s think step by step.

Examples
- What is the diameter of the sun? Let’s think step by step.
- What is the weight of an oxygen molecule? Let’s think step by step. 


#### Tabular Format Prompting:
Using tabular format with ChatGPT allows for clear organization and presentation of data, making it easier for the user to analyze and comprehend the output. This leads to more accurate understandings and insights.

**Prompt Formula**
1. [Your question].
2. What are the different categories you can break your answer into for more descriptiveness?
3. Now create one table that includes your original answer with these categories separated into different columns.

Examples
- What are the main factors of growing a YouTube channel?
- Please list the top 5 travel destinations in South America.


#### Ask Before Answer Prompting:
This framework is a technique to guide ChatGPT to ask for clarication before giving an answer. This helps ensure that the model’s answers are as accurate and specific as possible.

**Prompt Formula**
1. You are an expert in the field of [industry]. I’m going to ask you to complete some specific tasks, but before you answer, I want you to do the following: If you have any questions about my task or uncertainty about delivering the best answer possible, always ask bullet point questions for clarication before generating your answer. Is that understood?
2. Great, my question is [question]. Your task is to [task]. Please ask any questions you have so that I can improve my prompt before you complete your task.

Examples
- Great, my question is how can I drive more sales for my consulting business? Your task is to create a step by step guide for me to implement into my business. Please ask any questions you have so that I can improve my prompt before you complete your task.
- Great, my question is how can I use ChatGPT to maximize my productivity? Your task is to make a weekly schedule that I can follow. Please ask any questions you have so that I can improve my prompt before you complete your task.

#### Fill-In-The-Blank Prompting:
This format allows the user to focus on a specic aspect of a sentence or idea and encourages deeper thinking. Additionally, it is a flexible tool for learning and communication which can be easily adapted to different situations.

**Prompt Formula**
1. You are an expert at creating prompts that generate the most concise and resourceful responses. What additional bullet point details can I add to the following prompt to improve the output? My prompt is [your prompt].
2. Great, now turn these bullet points into a fill in the blank format which I can put my information into.

Examples
- I have $100,000 in savings, what should I invest in?
- How do I find and hire more talented designers for my fashion brand?

#### Perspective Prompting:
This framework can broaden your understanding and provide a more comprehensive view of the topic at hand. This can help you make more informed decisions and have a more nuanced understanding of complex issues.

**Prompt Formula**
- Singular Perspective: Please write about [topic] from the perspective of [view point].
- Multiple Perspectives: Please write an argument [for/against] the topic of [topic] from multiple diverse perspectives. Include the names and points of view of the different perspectives, such as [view points].

Examples
- Singular Perspective: Please write about improving as a kickboxer from the perspective of a kickboxing coach.
- Singular Perspective: Please write about improving as a kickboxer from the perspective of a human anatomy expert.
- Multiple Perspectives: Please write an argument against genetically modied organisms (GMOs) that considers multiple perspectives. Include the names and points of view of the dierent perspectives, such as a farmer, a consumer, and a geneticist.

#### Constructive Critic Prompting:
This prompt can provide objective and expert feedback on your writing, highlighting areas for improvement and offering constructive criticism to help you refine and enhance your copy.

**Prompt Formula**
- I want you to act as an expert and critic in the subject of [industry]. Criticize my content pasted below, convince me why it’s bad, and give me constructive criticism on how it should be improved. For some context, my [product or service] is for [details, demographic, etc]. The purpose of my [product or service] is to [your content goal]. Let’s think step by step and I want you to address each piece of content individually. Here is my content to critique, [your content].

Examples
- I want you to act as an expert and critic in the subject of fashion. Criticize my content pasted below, convince me why it’s bad, and give me constructive criticism on how it should be improved. For some context, my product description is for my clothing brand for 20 to 30 year old eco-friendly customers, who appreciate unique modern aesthetics. The purpose of my product description is to get costumers to purchase more clothing products. Let’s think step by step and I want you to address each piece of content individually. Here is my content to critique, “Introducing our latest addition to our eco-friendly clothing collection, the "Modern Vibes" t-shirt! Made from 100% organic cotton, this t-shirt not only feels great on your skin but is also kind to the environment. With a sleek and modern design, this t-shirt is perfect for the fashion-savvy 20 to 30 year old who wants to make a statement while still being conscious of their environmental impact."

#### Comparative Prompting:
Comparative prompting highlights key similarities and dierences across various factors which help you make more informed decisions and gain a deeper understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of two options.

**Prompt Formula**
- Please compare and contrast the following text examples. Outline the similarities, differences, qualitative characteristics, quantitative factors, functionality, impact, key takeaways, and other factors into one table. Here are the two pieces of content: [content 1] and [content 2].

Examples
- The business and design philosophy of Apple and Microsoft.
- Investing in real estate and investing in cryptocurrency.

#### Reverse Prompting:
These two frameworks offer incredible insights into how to eectively reverse engineer any piece of content. As a result, this presents endless possibilities for enhancing both personal and professional projects.

This prompting framework apparently takes some doing, as ChatGPT will sometimes try to just recycle the language you use in the content you provide.

**Prompt Formula**
Option 1
1. You are a prompt engineering expert that is able to reverse engineer prompts based on the text that is provided to you. I am going to provide you with [type of content]. Be as specic as possible on providing a prompting suggestion based on the tone, style, syntax, language, and any other factors you consider relevant. I would like to use this prompt in the future to replicate the style of the provided text. Your prompt is effective if, when entered into ChatGPT in a normal context, it would provide the script. Please reply with 'understood' if that makes sense. If this does not make sense, don't reply, and ask further questions to clarify your understanding.
2. Great, the text that I would like you to reverse engineer is [content].

Option 2 (gives a more decriptive output)
1. Let’s talk about reverse prompt engineering. By reverse prompt engineering, I mean creating a prompt from a given text.
2. Can you give me a simple example of reverse prompt engineering?
3. Great. Can you create a very technical reverse prompt engineering template?
4. Now reverse prompt engineer the following [your text]. Be sure to capture the tone, syntax, language, and writing style of the text for the prompt you come up with.

Examples
- Apple AirPods Copy - Wireless. Effortless. Magical. With plenty of talk and listen time, voice-activated Siri access, and an available wireless charging case, AirPods deliver an incredible wireless headphone experience. Simply take them out and they’re ready to use with all your devices. Put them in your ears and they connect immediately, immersing you in rich, high-quality sound. Just like magic.
- Title or Description from Bestselling Amazon Product - “Fire TV Stick 4K, brilliant 4K streaming quality, TV and smart home controls, free and live TV”


### General Prompt Frameworks

#### RGC Prompting
This framework presents a robust structure that can be applied universally to any input and intended output. Its objective is to establish a standardized format that optimizes the framing for ChatGPT and thereby enhances its performance across a broad spectrum of inputs.

**Prompt Formula**
- Role - ChatGPT’s persona (You are an expert marketer)
- Result - Desired output (Create 5 emails ending with a call to action)
- Goal - Purpose of the output (The goal is to drive sales to my product)
- Context - Who, what, where, why (The emails are for my online audience of entrepreneurs)
- Constraint - Limitations and guidelines (The emails should be friendly and less than 200 words)

Examples
- You are an expert [role]. Create [result]. The goal is [end goal]. The content is for [context]. Your guidelines for writing are [constraints].
- You are an expert marketer. Create 5 emails ending with a call to action. The goal is to drive sales to my product. The emails are for my online audience of entrepreneurs. The emails should be friendly and less than 200 words.
- You are an expert nutritionist. Create a 7 day meal plan for my 5 foot 7, 40 year old, female client who exercises 3 times a week. The goal is for her to lose 1 pound of fat a week by being in a caloric decit and eating the right amount of carbs, sugar, and protein. She doesn’t eat pork and wants to spend $200 per week on food. The meal plan should give the recipes, cooking directions, preparation times, and a specic meal for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.


#### I Want You To Act As Prompting:
This second option presents another robust structure that can be applied universally to any input and intended output. Its objective is to establish a standardized format that optimizes the framing for ChatGPT and thereby enhances its performance across a broad spectrum of inputs.

**Prompt Formula**
1) “I want you to act as a…” (historian, biologist, etc.) This helps to set the stage for ChatGPT’s persona.
2) “I will give you…” (my target audience, a specic direction, a product, etc.) This is where you set up the dynamic between you and ChatGPT.
3) “You will then…” (create 5 emails, make a video script, summarize, etc.)
4) “In a _____ tone/style…” (upbeat, professional, tabular format) This is where you explain your desired output along with the personality/style of writing for the output.
5) “The important details are…” (target audience, cost per project, etc.) Be sure to explain all important details and elaborate on specifics from bullet point 2.
6) Refine your output as needed “Be more persuasive” “Put the most important keywords in bold” “Now put this in tabular format”

Examples
• I want you to act as a personal coach. I will give you my personal and professional goals. You will then create a 7 day schedule in tabular format for me to follow in order to hit my goals. My short term daily goals are meditate, workout, read, and work on my projects. My long term goals are to sign 30 new clients and save $10,000 over the next 6 months.
• I want you to act as a virtual doctor. I will describe my symptoms and you will provide a diagnosis and treatment plan. You should only reply with your explanation, diagnosis, and treatment plan, and nothing else. My important details are, "I have been experiencing a headache and dizziness for the last few days, what could be the cause?”

## ChatGPT Enhancements, Extensions, and Advanced Features

### Custom Instructions
ChatGPT has a section for "Custom Instructions", which is a place where you can input context into ChatGPT so it can take that into account while you are chatting with it.

Here are a few templates to feed data into these Custom Instructions:

#### What would you like ChatGPT to know about you to provide better responses?
	Location:
	Profession/Role:
	Background:
	Key Responsibilities:
	Knowledge or Expertise:
	Jargon or Terminology:
	Typical Challenges:
	Current Projects:
	Goals and Objectives:

#### How would you like ChatGPT to respond?
	Tone: (formally, casually, with humor, etc...)
	Response Format: (Tabular, Bullet Points, Paragraphs)
	Response Style: (Creative, Precise, in style of, act as)
	Level of Detail: (How long/short should responses generally be?)
	Sources: (preferred sources or to cite sources)
	Bias: (Should ChatGPT have opinions on topics or remain neutral?)

In the case of a very long prompt, in the "How would you like ChatGPT to respond", you can actually put in your original prompt for it to not forget what your original prompt is, due to the token limit.


### Custom Instructions: Hotkeys
If there are prompts you continually enter, you can put in the "How would you like ChatGPT to respond?" box a few 'hotkeys' that stand for those questions. For example, you could put in this:

	When I type "5q", provide me 5 thought-provoking questions about the current topic
	When I type "3p", please give me 3 alternative prompts I could use to get the results I'm looking for

Then, in a chat about a topic, you can simply type "5q" and get those 5 thought provoking questions.

### ChatGPT4: Computer Vision
Author shows a conversation with ChatGPT on how it helps him setup VSCode through screenshots from his computer and where to throw in syntax for certain files and how to get the project up and running.

### ChatGPT-4o: Image Input and Output Capabilities
GPT-4o now available for free users. Can take image inputs and generate new images based on them

### ChatGPT-4o with Canvas: Interactive Visual Workspace

Lets you collaborate with AI by refininig content directly in a shared workspace.

This opens a document editor where you can collaborate. You can ask ChatGPT to adjust the length, change the reading level of a section, suggest edits, or add emojis.

There's even a "track changes" button in the editor so you can see what's been changed while you've been chatting with ChatGPT.

### ChatGPT Update: O1 Preview + O1 Mini + 4o Mini Part 1

New Models Released by OpenAI. Choosing between models require you to be a Plus user.

**O1 Preview**
- High stakes, accuracy-driven tasks. 
- Perfect for academic research, Complex Coding, or Scientific Analysis
- Slower and more costly, so it's best used selectively.
- This and O1 Mini don't have access to the internet

**O1 Mini**
- Fast and efficient for coding tasks and quick project iterations
- Balances speed and reasoning without the high cost of o1 preview
- Great for coding-focused, budget-friendly applicaitons
- This and O1 Preview don't have access to the internet

**GPT-4o Mini**
- Versatile, general-purpose and affordable
- Handles both text and image inputs
- Ideal for customer service, content generation, and multilingual tasks


### ChatGPT: Shared Chats

You can share the chat with co-workers or colleagues. However, sharing it will not update when you continue the conversation. It will only share the conversation up to this point.

You can also go to your settings to show all of your shared links and delete those shared links individually.

The person you send the chat to can also continue the chat with GPT themselves

### ChatGPT Temporary Chat
You can actually set a chat as temporary, which won't appear in your history, use or create memories, or be used to train ChatGPT's models.

You can still use custom instructions.

Turn on for privacy or one-time questions.

### ChatGPT Desktop App
Windows users need a paid plan to use the Desktop app, but Mac users can use it for free.

Can instantly launch the app from your desktop.

Companion windows that stay on top of other windows and you can add files directly from your computer.

You can also use voice to text on the Desktop app.

### ChatGPT-4: DALL-E 3
You can choose the DALL-E 3 mode in ChatGPT to have ChatGPT to create an image.

It can also generate text in the image very easily, which is uncommon for older AI models.

### DALL-E 3: Gen IDs
Gen IDs are a unique code that's generated internally for each image DALL-E 3 creates and, if you ask ChatGPT for the code, it will give it to you.

Then you can use this code to reference that exact image.

Game changer for consistency between images

**Cross-referencing** - take 2 different Gen IDs and have ChatGPT combine them.

Seems like cross-referencing takes some doing, as sometimes ChatGPT gets it really wrong.

Also lets us create characters that look like they come out of the same world, meaning you can make comics, stories, etc...


### DALL-E 3: Inpainting
Allows you to edit parts of an existing image by highlighting part of an image you want to change and describing what changes you want to take place.

So you can add a flock of birds in the sky, or decrease the number of clouds, etc... 

After you inpaint an image, DALL-E 3 creates an updated prompt describing the new image, so you can also grab that and use it to for further prompting or further iteration.


### ChatGPT Team Workspace
There's a "Team" subscription tier with ChatGPT where you can exclude OpenAI training on your data, and invite other people to your ChatGPT team.

You can also create custom GPTs that are only available in your ChatGPT Team, but are available for everyone in the team to use.

### OpenAI Playground Overview

https://platform.openai.com/playground/

The Playground gives you a chatGPT like interface where you have more control over many parameters, like max length, temperature, etc...

You can also use the "Assistants" model when you want to add instructions to the model to fine-tune it.
