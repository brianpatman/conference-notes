Top 3 reasons you can't afford to not be on Amazon, even with fees
Help you see if Amazon is a good fit for your business


Case Study - Commercial Landscape Engineering Company
	- 30% increase in ROI


Why do businesses avoid selling on Amazon?
	1) Concerned about the "high fees"
		- Only get charged with purchases or if you're using their warehouse
		- 15% seller fee across the board
		- Two ways; you "fulfill by seller" send products out of your own warehouse or "fulfill by amazon", which is you send your product to Amazon and they handle storing, shipping, returns, etc...
		- People go to Amazon to purchase because they trust it
		- Would not sell for cheaper on Amazon, in fact raising prices in certain instances so you can offset these fees
	2) Worried about Amazon cannibalizing Website sales
		- If you set prices lower on Amazon, you can actually cannibalize sales on your own website
		- But, we don't see that when the prices on Amazon are higher than your website
		- 91% of customers on Prime only consider Amazon for online purchases. 153M subscribers in US alone.
	3) One more thing to manage
		- There is a definite strategy and initial investment to have success on Amazon
		- Disruptive can take on that headache for you


Top 3 reasons you can't afford to not be on Amazon
	1) High Trust 
		- With amazon's fast shipping and strong return policy, more shoppers are trusting Amazon than ever before. 89% of buyers interviewdd stated Amazon is their choice over any other e-commerce platform
	2) Missing Market Share
		- 1 out of 2 e-commerce purchases in US happen on Amazon
		- 8 out of 10 electronics purchases happen on Amazon 
	3) More Exposure for your Brand
		- Being on Amazon builds your brand authority and legitimizes your brand.
		- There are instances where website traffic skyrockets because they start listing on Amazon.
		- If your products rank high, it can be "free advertising" for your products and brand


Case Study - Industrial Floor Cleaning MAchines
	- Launched their Amazon account 4 weeks ago and they are up to $66k in revenue and are growing
	- On Website, they did about $20k a month with that product line

	B2B Sales on Amazon are possible, not just B2C
	Amazon Business is growing rapidly right now; a lot of these wholesalers are now going to Amazon Business because everything is all in one place.


How to Get Started on Amazon
	- Identify which products make the most sense for you to sell on Amazon
		- What competition is out there? Lots? None at all?
	- Create a seller account (we can put you in touch with our Amazon Rep to see if you qualify for their assistance with their growth team)
		- sellercentral.amazon.com or "Sell on Amazon" in google
		- Amazon Growth Team - Bonused and Incentivized to help you succeed on Amazon if you are a new business that has never sold on Amazon before
	- Determine your fulfillment method
		- Devote some shipments to Amazon or do you ship them yourself?
		- If fullfill via Amazon, that helps in a few ways
			- Amazon deals with returns
			- Amazon deals with shipping your items out
			- If product gets damaged in shipping or some shipping problem comes up, Amazon will take off any 1 star reviews due to shipping related problems or damage due to shipping, since it's on them


Expect to invest and work to get the right strategy to get put in place for a buiness
	- Can take 3-6 Months before hitting profitability when working with an agency
	- May take double or more than that if you are doing this on your own

	- We Can Help Your Products Rank -> Very time-intensive process taht leverages high-cost tools that we have access to in-house
	- Industry Experience -> Benefit from our combined experience working with many different e-commerce brands and the trends we're seeing


Case Study - Health and Fitness Company
	- YoY average monthly revenue has doubled since using Amazon


Disruptive has tools that are kind of expensive for one company to run, but it makes sense for them to run because they have multiple clients they can use them on



When it's not the right time to work with an agency
	- When you're just getting your business started
		- Can you set aside the money to really invest and get Amazon to grow and work for your business right now?
		- Put together a calculator for every client that gives you a detailed breakdown of your costs and profits
	- When you're trying to save the business
		- Amazon isn't a short-term strategy to be used as a "Hail Mary Pass".
		- More for businesses looking to scale and grow to add an additional revenue stream

Amazon Handmade Listings
Rep to work with Amazon growth team - New brand on Amazon and have been with Amazon for under a year
	- Looking for businesses in the process of creating their seller account or they have been up for a year with less than $10k in sales; sometimes flexible, but those are the two rules

Kindle E-Books
	- Lots of experience with this
	- Amazon has KDP where you don't even need to create an Amazon Seller acocunt, just an Kindle account. Then you can link in a PDF.
	- AMazon can print books on demand for you for a fee
	- You can sell it for free for kindle members, but every page turned is a few cents in your pocket. You can get direct sales revenue and royalties for pages turned by Kindle members.

Amazing clients actually can build big businesses on Amazon
	- Brand awareness is unbelievable
	- TikTok products - people go straight to Amazon

Sometimes, even if you aren't ready to sell on Amazon, create the Seller account. This is because rules on Amazon may change, but creating the account now may mean you get grandfathered in to the rules that are available right now.

Disruptive won't work with some clients because partnering with us wouldn't work out for them.

How High-Intent is the search traffic on Amazon?
	- Products nad Conversion rates at around 10% or higher
	- Very bottom-funnel by nature; people are coming to Amazon to buy
	- People don't typically go to Amazon "just to look"
	- Conversions on going to Amazon may be even higher than on your website


"I have a question about product setup strategy - we have a product that has over 500 variations between sizing and color. Is it better to have a parent product page for each size with those colors? Or all under the same parent product?"
	-Unless the products are different styles, go ahead and put them all in one
	- Has positive reviews all in one, but also negative reviews
	- Also can see everything within one admin panel
	- Brand Defense - Show other products on your pages instead of your competition's products, so if you only have this one product, that might be harder to pull off

You can also set, if under "Fulfilled by Merchant", to have some of your products be customized before shipping them off. Amazon won't do that sort of thing for you.
