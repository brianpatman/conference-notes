## Historic Google Updates

Google's Search Engine updates are all going towards a specific goal

Evolution in Google towards 
	- How do we find quality content? 
	- How do we find spam? 
	- And then a hard hit that surprises everyone.

A much bigger emphasis on helpful content came in 2023. 

You usually get a core alogirthm update quarterly

## 2023 Google Search Updates
- 4 core updates
- 3 reviews update
- 1 spam update
- 1 helpful content update
- 1 bug fix


## March 2024 Core Update
Announced March 5, Google rolled out a core update that weeds out low-quality, unoriginal results and more aggressively targets spam, especially what they are calling "scaled content abuse"

Q: Is the update complete or are we still seeing the dust settle?

A: Google says it's done updating, but you are still seeing ranks change. There's a butterly effect of when one system changes, some systems don't immediately change. There's a period of volatility after an update where a site will bounce between doing poorly and doing well, but you need to wait for things to settle before knowing how your site is truly doing.

Google will sometimes say "maybe do nothing for your site if you are getting these bounces between doing well and doing poor during an update, until the dust settles". Cold comfort for someone's livelihood, but it's because Google, in the dust settling after an update, is sort of rebalancing all of the different factors it looks for.

A: Search Engine Results page layout also evolves and where ads are on the page is also evolving. So it may not even be anything with Google's algorithm update, but a layout update on the search results page that is causing issues with users getting to your site.

Erin Myers-Vidal says to her bosses, which is her least favorite thing, that after a core Google algorithm update is complete, you still need to wait 30-90 days to truly see how it's going to impact our website. Wait where the dust will settle.

A: It might be scary at first, because you see your rank drop in Google, but changing something to "be better" might eventually flip and hamper you within that 90 day window.



Q: Why do you think they broke out the Spam update to be separate from the Core update?

A: First, I think it's based simply on how their systems work; there's a core system and a spam-fighting system. But, on the other part, they are trying to figure out what to do with AI. They can't say just "don't use AI on your site", and Google is offering AI solutions too. 

So they'll have to injest content that their own system has created. So they are more like "We're not against AI, but we are against low-quality scaled content; if you had humans write this and it was bad, we wouldn't let this fly either."


Google is seeing a lot of new spam because AI makes it really easy to dump out a lot of low-quality content with a simple prompt. So low-level junky websites are flooding the internet, so they needed a second update just to deal with that.
 
"It's so easy to generate too much content with no value and that's what Google is trying to fight"



## SEO Predictions for 2024
- You will be rewarded for authoritative content and trust factors that are hard to fake. It's become EEAT instead of EAT, adding in Experience. 
	- "We want to see real-world knowledge and first-world experience with things that AI can't know. As opposed to AI regurgitating a combination of all the reviews it's ever seen."
	- AI's don't ACTUALLY know things. They just regurgitate text to make it seem like they know things.
	- Google is going to want more personalized, authentic content, if possible.
	- Google will continue down it's path of very personalized search results for each user
- Search will become even more personalized, intent-specific, and media-rich
- Google will continue to maximize sponsored results placements
- Google will accept helpful AI-generated content as it combats a flood of AI spam
- Generative AI will be woven into serach, but it won't replace it.


"You could rank #1 in the old sense, but be 2 pages down because there are just so many personalized results."

Core updates focusing on the core ethos of improving user experience across search results; personalization, relevant results, etc...



Q: Have there been specific industries or sites that you've seen impacted the most?

A: The ones where the trustworthiness of your site matters the most; YMYL sites. Investing, Health, etc... are being scrutinized the hardest. You are being rewarded if you can prove you have that expertise and experience. You can possibly achive this by listing who the author is, what their credentials are, etc...



Google, beyond keywords, is building a whole understanding of everything in the world and relating those to each other.


He was working on a site the other day for a medical facility with specialists who do certain surgeries and they have a lot of educational content on their site. How they benefited their rankings was that 
- They made sure they had editorial policies on the site that explained the medical reviews and that these articles were reviewed by doctors
- Author pages for the doctors that built out who they are, where they went to school, what certs they have, etc...
- Adding Schema format data for those doctors to be in a more readily digestible format for Google to integrate into it's knowledge graph.
- Doctors having Wikipedia pages and making sure that's all updated too.

To basically show Google why they should listen to them and that they aren't a bot that scraped a ton of WebMD articles and re-published them. That it was actually original content written by Medical Experts and Doctors.

"Original Content by a Credible Source"
"Building Credibility into the Structure of the Article"
"Not Generated by AI"

Giving Google the dots to connect on who the articles are written by

"Google is wanting to map out real experience and real knowledge to the end-user. It's all about the user experience."

"Lean into what you are an expert on and what people constantly ask about."

"Talk to your Sales or CST team; what questions do they answer on a daily basis, which is a great place to start"

Search is often "Other people also searched for this"

## Key Takeaways
- Get Backlinks
- Build Trust
- Fill Content Gaps
- Develop your Knowledge Graph
- Expand your Web Presence




## How do the search algorithm generate a result?
Google actually has many algorithms

1) Meaning of your query
2) Relevance of Content
3) Quality of Content
4) Usability of Webpages
5) Context and Settings
	- So, it'll give different results to people on mobile, at certain times of day, at certain places, than it will to someone on desktop, at a different time of day and a different place. Google is trying to localize things for you.
	- You could have top rankings for someone in one place and no rankings for someone in another place.


## Be where Google Looks for Things

You can't just think of "I have this one blog post, so I have SEO". You have to think about what Google is going to pull from to populate the search result.

Do you have a presence where you need to be found?
- Your Site
- Content Strategy (Search intent/funnel)
- Schema
- Google Business Profile
- Google Ads
- Google News
- Google Shopping
- Google Images
- Google Discover
- YouTube

If you don't have all of these above things, and Google decides that's the content you want to show, then you just aren't shown.

Is the user you are trying to reach being shown videos, images, etc...?

So many other things are part of search now that, SEO is no longer "the keywords I want to rank for". Its about "How much of that page/how many of those searches benefit me or my client?" Because it might be a third-party site that rank and there's no hope of you ranking for this one search term. 

But could you get those sites to review you or could you build a relationship with that site?

Expand your thinking beyond "one site, one space, one keyword" to "the whole search experience"

Key takeaway that people can focus on - It doesn't happen in a day and takes time energy, effort. You need to be strategic where you put your time, energy, and effort. But if you can play across all of these platforms, you have a better odds of being able to grab some of that kind of search real estate.

It just takes time, energy, and effort. Prioritize what you do to what's goign to be more impactful at first and then optimize from there.

Take the time to go through and build out all of your profiles with up to date phone numbers, hours, etc...

When you show a local business a list like this, it can look daunting, but you can do a phased approach. Even if you don't like Yelp, for instance, you need to start looking at building some kind of presence there, even if you don't intend to fully support all these kinds of listings. And then focus on the ones you have the time and budget.

## Using Google to do your own competitor analysis

Not sure if this is what anyone on the webinar is diong, but this is a great way to see how Google is ranking competitors and who Google thinks your competitors are.

Agency comes across very successful companies but they aren't recognized that way by search and the smaller guy who just got started a few years ago is ranking better via search.

once you find your competitors via Google, you can see who your competitors are and how do you combat that?

[Search engine image with "hellofresh vs " and autocomplete results]

Company with a good reputation doesn't invest in web, and then smaller companies that don't have the reputation and experience of the bigger company get better search results

"Your website is truly the front door of your business and you should assume most of the people who walk into your brick and mortar store look into your web presence first."

Google's SERP is showing your business next to all of your competitors, so you can see "similar brands" and "people also buy from". This is another way to do competitor research.

## Featured Snippets & How do you get into this?

People always want to get into the Featured Snippet; the original 0 position.

Google has to decide whether it shows this featured snippet or not for this query. It's mainly for informational searches or people looking for very specific answers.

It's mainly how you write it and the schema on the page.

You can format the content to where, if you know there's a thing people often search for, you can write an H2 or other heading followed by bullet points answering that search directly. Give Google that really easy-to-grab snippet.

Google loves bulleted lists, very well-structured lists, etc..

Google's not really using FAQ schema how it used to, but there's no harm in adding it to your site. There is some indication that Google will use schema they don't officially endorse as a ranking factor, as a way of sneaking keywords into the page.

Schema should have content that is in the page too. Don't just keyword stuff it.

When you think of UX and your website, the listings and the way you answer questions and how you organize that above the fold MATTERS. Who reads super long paragraphs anymore?

People want to find what they are looking for quickly, they want the right answer, they want some trustworthy factors and then they can engage and convert. This matters not only to robots in search and to the crawl, but also to the end user.

Ultimately the things that are going to be useful to the person who is coming to your site, not just rank.

### Client Story
Client Story about client who had content was ranking really well, but was really irrelevant to their business (something they did for a holiday or something). They were afraid that if they removed it, that their traffic would plummet. But looking into Analytics, the pro found that this content hadn't even led to a single conversion or sale!

So removing it will remove traffic, but that traffic isn't relevant to your business anyway and your conversion rate will look better. If it's irrelevant traffic, what do you care if you lose it?

It's important to know what really matters to your success?

Are you speaking your customers language? Are you reaching the right people who will benefit from the services you provide?

There are times that you might want traffic that doesn't convert that is *somewhat relevant*, because that gets you into other markets. You can retarget them now and run ads against them to get them into your funnel later. But if it is truly irrelevant traffic, and the user is never going to convert, you have better places to spend your time and money.

## Suggested Search

Google is evolving to show what other people have been looking for and you've seen this under the "Related Searches" at the bottom.

It's a great way to piggyback ideas and content when you are talking about rich snippets bullet points, etc... Use this as a tool to see what keywords are getting decent volume and figure out your content strategy.

## Discussions, Forums, & Buying Guides

Google has Discussions and Forums as a separate callout and there is some question as why Reddit is now suddenly ranking well.

And they think it's just because Reddit is of people with firsthand experience, so there's a reason why that's now showing higher. Quora also gets pulled into there.

Google is also generating these "Buying Guides", where it pulls in certain specific things about a product. So, for a digital camera, there's a Buying guide with the following accordion labels:

- Megapixels: How many megapixels is a good quality camera?
- Viewfinder: What is a viewfinder on a digital camera?
- Price: How much does a digital camera cost?
- Zoom: What is the difference between digital and optical zoom on a camera?


## Shopping Experience & Explore Brands
We are also seeing a shopping experience similar to an e-commerce site with filters if you have products on your site.

Also, you can Explore Brands to where if you are looking for "Air Fryers", Google will show you brands it associates with that product (Ninja, Dash, GoWise USA, etc..) If you look up a specific product, it'll not only show you products, but brands it associates with those products.

## Embedded Videos with Timestamps

The idea is that Google can watch your YouTube videos, timestamp them, know what you are talking about in different points in the video, and pull them into Search Results. Google will pull from so many places now.

So, for example, if you know people are looking for a how to video and you don't have one, you should probably get one! You can optimize the video so Google will pop out the specific clip into the search results that is most relevant to the search, even in the search itself.

## Knowledge Graph

Google is understanding relationships between things. 

	JRR Tolkien ----author of---> The Lord of the Rings (novel)
	JRR Tolkien -----born in----> Bloemfontein
	JRR Tolkien -----died in----> Bournemouth   ----a town in----> United Kingdom

Lesson here is to have good schema on your website and have good structure to your website that connects authors to pages, pages to topics, etc...

Wikipedia is one of the main sources that Google pulls to build knowledge graphs, but not the only one. If you can get a Wikipedia page and you can keep it up to date and accurate, that will help. But it's often hard enough to be considered noteworthy enough to get a wikipedia page.

## Cultivate your Knowledge Graph Entity

- Build Backlinks
- Add schema, even "unofficial" ones
- Develop your off-site digital presences
- Get into Wikipedia and Authoritative Data sources
- Claim your knowledge panel if you have one

## The New E in E-A-T

Experience joins Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness

Google wants to see first-hand real-world experience, **not generic advice**.

Ask yourself, what can you say about your topic that ChatGPT couldn't know?

You can use ChatGPT to augment or help you do something, but not to do it all. You need someone with human experience to fact-check it and make sure it's good. Or to have AI clean up your writing as a fancy spell-check. But you don't want it to generate the content itself.

AI is great for generating ideas or an outline or ideate on a topic, but you ultimately want a human copywriter and provide your unique thoughts and human expertise.

## Hidden Gems Update

Google says "We're also improving how we rank results in Search overall, with a greater focus on content with unique expertise and experience."

"In the coming months, we'll roll out an update to this system that more deeply understands content created from a personal or expert point of view."

## What about Search Generative Experience (SGE)?

Agency Expert has a mixed experience with Gemini AI on a newer Pixel 8 phone. 

He doesn't think Google is convinced people want AI for everything and what he is seeing is it will or won't show the AI-generated SGE. So it's kind of more like a featured snippet to where it decides based on what you are searching and if Google thinks you want it or not.

The source for the SGE content is the same source as the featured snippet.

There isn't a special way to rank for the Gemini rankings, as it's using the same SEO that we've always used.

Google has a problem with SGE in that it's expensive to operate and it takes up places where they can put ads. So they have to figure out how much users really want this and how much do they want to use it to keep users on the platform, but they probably don't want to go overboard with generating it.

Notes
- Users who opt in may get SGE above the traditional organic listings. This adds another "zero-click" rich result
- Google is still working to solve AI's problems with inaccuracies, hallucinations, and providing bad answers
- We have yet to see if users will widely adopt SGE. Google is testing where and when users want SGE
- Because Gemini tends to pull it's answers from the top-ranking pages, normal SEO also targets it
- So far, SGE is functionally just another featured snippet that takes up screen real estate

## Questions & Answers
Q: What's something actionable to take away for your SEO?
A: Main Takeaway is to add Schema to your site if you don't already have it. There are ones Google officially tells you to use, but there are others that are not "offical" (in that Google doesn't say it supports), but they are still seeing benefits to using it.

So you add Organization schema, author schema, and that allows Google to expand out their knowledge panel for sites and more easily digest that information. Strictly label it. WordPress sites will sometimes have auto-generated schema.

You can also use Google Tag Manager to add certain schema to pages.

A: Play in all their products and make sure you are there and you are represented in everything Google has in their products. This just adds credibility to your site.



Q: Do you think Google will stay the leader of search and do you use any others?
A: Google is here to stay. We've seen Bing make a little gain, as well as DuckDuckGo and others that are better for privacy. Google is certainly the most invasive.

He doesn't see Google going away. It's overwhelmingly Google at this point. There would have to be some crazy big problem for them to not maintain their position in search.

They do have to take a lot of steps to adapt to newer more strict privacy laws in Europe for example. In EU, they have to eal with an issue where they can't favor one business over another in an anti-competitive way. So in EU, they are likely going to show third-party review websites higher to stay within the law.

They are having to adapt to privacy laws, but it's going to be really hard to dethrone Google as a search engine.

GA4 was rolled out so aggressively because the old UA that we all know and love was not going to survive modern privacy laws. So they had to rebuild analytics around that.

"RIP UA"

"UA used to be Urchin Analytics instead of Universal Analytics back in the day"
