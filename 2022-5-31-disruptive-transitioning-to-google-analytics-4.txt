##### Notes from Disruptive GA4 Webinar #####
#############################################

GA4 - Only option is GA4 if you set up a new website
	- Privacy Sensitive, Data Secure solution
	- Machine Learning to model conversions/events
	- Deduplicates some of the cross-device events that exist

July 1, 2023 -> Standard UA properties will no longer process new data
	You'll be able to access historical data for a period of time after, however new data will only flow into GA4 properties
Estimated January 1, 2024 -> No more access to UA historical data. Google notes to export your historical reports before then

What to do before June 30th, 2022
	- Upgrade to GA4 -> This sets you up to have Year-over-Year data in GA4 once GA4 fully takes over on July 1st, 2023
	- Complete the migration checklist -> This ensures your new analytics property is setup correctly and pulling in the appropriate data
		-A lot of companies are clicking "Upgrade to GA4", but not much else. Instead, you need to follow the checklist Google provides


We've got 30 days; lets get this implemented in the month of June


### Features we're most excited about ###

Simple, Efficient, and Custom Intelligent Insights
	- Insights that are driven by Machine Learning and AI
	- Go deeper to understand the effectiveness of campaigns and platforms
	- App / Web crossover
	- Insights are customizable

GA4 Combines Web & App Data in one
	- Also uses session data to merge them

Improves Cross-Device & Cross-Platform Data
	- User journeys across identity spaces (de-duplication)
	- Traiditional UA relies heavily on device ID
	- GA4 uses User ID, device ID, and Google Signals

Linking GA4 to BigQuery
	- More indepth analysis and visualisation of data

Migration Checklist
	- Setup your new GA4 property alongside your existing UA property to collect data
	-
	- New Item - Consider channel groupings and UTM tagging; revise where necessary


### Next Steps ###

Select a Migration Option
	- Your Web Admin / Tag Team implements
	- Disruptive Team implements


Holistic Results & Strategy
	- We saw a lot of consumer behavior change and now that COVID is mostly mitigated, we're seeing that behavior change again
	- Need a view of what is happening year over year so we can look at those trends very regularly

How Disruptive is leveraging Improved Data Solutions for our clients
	- iOS 14.5 -> Apps need to ask for permission to track; resulted in Facebook Ad accounts data loss
	- Getting GA4 implemented today allows you to run it side-by-side along with your UA properties for the next 12-14 months until UA doesn't process data, allowing you to compare results. 
	- We will be able to see the impact of the new iOS system and compare the reporting before Universal Analytics is gone
		- Two different ways of tracking
	- Basic UA account didn't allow you to export data to BigQuery; GA4 allows you to export your data into BigQuery and make your own data warehouse
		- GA4 is free; now allows you to export customer data
		- BigQuery is not free, but is affordable to store first-party customer data
	- GA4 Models conversions with AI/Machine Learning when conversion data isn't available

How is it different from CRM?
	- BigQuery isn't designed for lots of changes over time; it's basically a SQL database
	- Most data is automaticaly added/updated/appended from external sources
	- Not intended for a whole lot of users in there to be appending data
	- A variety of ways to call from that data into reports. Can run into email service provider
	- CRM is not going to track everything across your customers interaction with your brands (from web to email interactions)
	- Google is automatically going to delete data from it's data to be privacy centric, but you can attach that into BigQuery
	- Run campaigns on facebook from those lists to be able to re-engage dormant users
